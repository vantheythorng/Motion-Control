# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following

# class:

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to

# MediaPipe's native code looks up Java classes, fields and methods by name over JNI (e.g.
# MediaPipeException, ProtoUtil$SerializedMessage.typeName/value), and its AARs ship no consumer
# keep rules. Without these, R8 strips or renames them and GestureRecognizer creation fails in
# release builds ("Gesture recognizer could not be created").

# MediaPipe logs through Flogger, which finds its caller by walking the stack for its own class

# "IllegalStateException: no caller found on the stack for: <obfuscated FluentLogger>".
